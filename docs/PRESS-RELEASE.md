## Connect the future with the present.  Send a memento to someone you care about to experience in the future

mementos is a mobile application focused on helping us separate which moments in life are special and how we can resurface those moments with the right narrative to the right audience in the future.  Users can use mementos to create custom blogs (“mementos”) featuring photo, video, and audio notes (“moments”) that are targeted at particular recipients to receive automatically beginning at future dates selected by the users.  Unlike a time capsule, a memento is a collection of items wrapped in a narrative that a user is specifically creating for someone else.  The application makes both the process of creating mementos and developing a narrative seamless.

“We do not want you to lose the meaning behind those special moments in your life.  Our goal with mementos is to connect the present and the future and truly break down the barrier of time,” said [Person] from company.

Download the app, add a moment, send it off, and know that your moment will be felt again.
